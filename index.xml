      <description>Our website builds with Hugo static site generator and Mainroad theme. This demo allows you to see what Mainroad based website looks like before deciding to go with it. Just keep in mind that the current demo shows the basics, a small part of what the combination of Hugo and Mainroad can do.
About Mainroad Mainroad is a responsive, simple, clean and content-focused Hugo theme based on the MH Magazine lite WordPress theme.</description>

      <description>Shiqi Ye is a third-year Joint Ph.D. student between the Chow Institute, Xiamen University and the Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
His research areas include econometrics, financial econometrics, climate economics, regional economics, energy economics, and the Chinese economy.
His current research is mainly focused on:
Estimate high-dimensional time-varying coefficients vector-autoregressive models; Extend the matrix-valued autoregressive model to allow for multiple matrices; Investigate the impacts of climate risk on the expected growth and growth-at-risk in China; Construct the urban financial condition index, and examine its impact on the growth of housing prices; Combine a large DCC-GARCH model with MIDAS and construct a high-dimensional short- and long-term time-varying correlation network of financial markets.</description>
