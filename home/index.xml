His research areas include econometrics, financial econometrics, climate economics, regional economics, and the Chinese economy.
His current research is mainly focus on:
Estimate high-dimensional time-varying coefficients vector-autoregressive models; Extend the matrix-valued autoregressive model to allow for multiple matrices; Investigate the impacts of climate risk on the expected growth and growth-at-risk in China; Construct the urban financial condition index, and examine its impact on the growth of housing prices; Combine a large DCC-GARCH model with MIDAS and construct a high-dimensional short- and long-term time-varying correlation network of financial markets.</description>
